# Abstract
This repository aims to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh by combining 3 metrics each created by one of our team members. We chose datasets on Income, Education, and Race because we hold those as valuable statistics for any neighborhood. A neighborhood without all three of these cannot thrive.
