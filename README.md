## Finale üèÅ

For the next few weeks, we will be working on the final project! On week one, I will explain the project and what you need to know in order to do it. Also, I will assign your groups! Let's do this.


## Getting Started‚Ñ¢

1. In Canvas (canvas.pitt.edu), click on this class, CMPINF0010
2. Go to Modules
5. Click `Skills Lab Final Project` and click where is says `Click Here!`
6. JupyterHub should open up to this week's materials!


### If JupyterLab _still_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to your computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:
